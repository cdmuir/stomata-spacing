	abstract = {Stomata are key innovations for the diversification of land plants. They consist of two differentiated epidermal cells or guard cells and a pore between that leads to an internal cavity. Mosses and hornworts are the earliest among extant land plants to have stomata, but unlike those in all other plants, bryophyte stomata are located exclusively on the sporangium of the sporophyte. Liverworts are the only group of plants that are entirely devoid of stomata. Stomata on leaves and stems of tracheophytes are involved in gas exchange and water transport. The function of stomata in bryophytes is highly debated and differs from that in tracheophytes in that they have been implicated in drying and dehiscence of the sporangium. Over the past decade, anatomical, physiological, developmental, and molecular studies have provided new insights on the function of stomata in bryophytes. In this review, we synthesize the contributions of these studies and provide new data on bryophyte stomata. We evaluate the potential role of stomata in moss and hornwort life histories and we identify areas that will provide valuable data in ascertaining the evolutionary history and function of stomata across land plants.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            Lateral diffusion of {CO}2 was investigated in photosynthesizing leaves with different anatomy by gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence imaging using grease to block stomata. When one-half of the leaf surface of the heterobaric species Helianthus annuus was covered by 4-mm-diameter patches of grease, the response of net {CO}2 assimilation rate (A) to intercellular {CO}2 concentration (Ci) indicated that higher ambient {CO}2 concentrations (Ca) caused only limited lateral diffusion into the greased areas. When single 4-mm patches were applied to leaves of heterobaric Phaseolus vulgaris and homobaric Commelina communis, chlorophyll a fluorescence images showed dramatic declines in the quantum efficiency of photosystem {II} electron transport (measured as Fq′/Fm′) across the patch, demonstrating that lateral {CO}2 diffusion could not support A. The Fq′/Fm′ values were used to compute images of Ci across patches, and their dependence on Ca was assessed. At high Ca, the patch effect was less in C. communis than P. vulgaris. A finite-volume porous-medium model for assimilation rate and lateral {CO}2 diffusion was developed to analyze the patch images. The model estimated that the effective lateral {CO}2 diffusion coefficients inside C. communis and P. vulgaris leaves were 22\% and 12\% of that for free air, respectively. We conclude that, in the light, lateral {CO}2 diffusion cannot support appreciable photosynthesis over distances of more than approximately 0.3 mm in normal leaves, irrespective of the presence or absence of bundle sheath extensions, because of the {CO}2 assimilation by cells along the diffusion pathway.},

Lower stomatal density was compensated for by increased stomatal aperture and conversely, increased stomatal density was compensated for by reduced stomatal aperture. At high light intensities the assimilation rates and stomatal conductance of {SDD}1 over-expressers were reduced to 80\% of those in wild type plants. Areas beneath stomata and patches lacking stomata were analysed separately. In areas without stomata, maximum fluorescence yield (Fv / Fm) and quantum yield of photosystem {II} (Φ {PSII}) were significantly lower than in areas beneath stomata. In areas beneath stomata, Fv / Fm and Φ {PSII} were identical to levels measured in wild type leaves. At high light intensities over-expressers showed decreased photochemical quenching ({qP}) compared with wild types. However, the decrease of {qP} was significantly stronger in areas without stomata than in mesophyll areas beneath stomata. At high {CO}2 partial pressures and high light intensities {CO}2 assimilation rates of {SDD}1 over-expressers did not reach wild type levels. These results indicate that photosynthesis in {SDD}1 over-expressers was reduced because of limiting {CO}2 in areas furthest from stomata at high light.},

            Stomata regulate the supply of {CO}2 for photosynthesis and the rate of water loss out of the leaf. The presence of stomata on both leaf surfaces, termed amphistomy, increases photosynthetic rate, is common in plants from high light habitats, and rare otherwise. In this study I use optimality models based on leaf energy budget and photosynthetic models to ask why amphistomy is common in high light habitats. I developed an R package leafoptimizer to solve for stomatal traits that optimally balance carbon gain with water loss in a given environment. The model predicts that amphistomy is common in high light because its marginal effect on carbon gain is greater than in the shade, but only if the costs of amphistomy are also lower under high light than in the shade. More generally, covariation between costs and benefits may explain why stomatal and other traits form discrete phenotypic clusters.},

	abstract = {"Stomatal clustering," an abnormal stomatal patterning that is formed by two or more stomata in the leaf epidermis, has been reported in more than 60 species of terrestrial plants. According to the characters and distributional pattern, two different types of stomatal clusters were identified, However, calculation of R-values in 16 different plant species showed that the classical method in spatial ecology study could not distinguish between these two types of clusters. Therefore, to classify them, the term "contiguous cluster" and "non-contiguous cluster" were introduced. Their formation and ecological significance were also discussed. In order to study whether stomatal clustering occurs in response to the environment, Vicia faba L. were cultivated under different water/salinity levels. Epidermis bioassay was conducted 2 weeks after the treatment. The results showed that drought and salt stresses significantly increased the stomatal density and stomatal index. More importantly, the occurrences of contiguous stomatal clustering also raised along the drought/salt gradients. The result suggests that the stomatal clustering is correlated with environmental signals. It could serve as a new marker for environmental adaptation in terrestrial plants.},
