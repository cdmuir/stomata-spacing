	abstract = {1. We measured the effects of variation in corolla curvature and nectary aperture radius on pollinator foraging ability using the hawkmoth Manduca sexta and 3D-printed artificial flowers whose shapes were mathematically specified. 2. In dimorphic arrays containing trumpet-shaped flowers and flat-disc flowers, hawkmoths were able to empty the nectaries of significantly more trumpet-shaped flowers regardless of nectary aperture size. Interestingly, trumpet-shaped flowers needed to deviate only slightly from the flat-disc morphotype in order to significantly increase hawkmoth foraging ability. 3. Whole-flower three-dimensional shape, particularly corolla curvature, has the potential to act as a mechanical guide for M. sexta, further implicating direct flower-proboscis contact as an important contributor to foraging success during flower handling in hawkmoths.},

	abstract = {A computer model is presented which is capable of calculating both the photosynthetic efficiency (I) of any specified plant shape and the stress related to the total moment arm (M) imposed on vertical branching patterns. Computer simulations indicate that a flattened plant thallus and an erect branching growth habit are two plant shapes capable of optimizing photosynthetic efficiency during indeterminate growth. These two morphologies have geometric analogues in the dorsiventral thalli of some bryophytes and in the vertical axes of mosses and tracheophytes, respectively. Extension of the model to complex, three-dimensional branching patterns indicates that I and I/M are maximized when branching is overtopped (treelike, with lateral branches on a main axis) and when lateral branching systems are planated (frondlike). Geometric alterations of branching patterns that result in optimization of I and I/M can be simulated by computer and are shown to be similar to morphologic alterations attending the early evolution of vascular land plants. It is suggested that a number of major evolutionary trends seen in Upper Silurian to Upper Devonian times can be expressed in terms of optimizing the display of photosynthetic tissues (I) or the balance between photosynthetic efficiency and incurred moment arms (I/M).},

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2021.04.25.441252},
	abstract = {The size and density of stomatal pores limit the maximum rate of leaf carbon gain and water loss (
            g
            max
            ) in land plants. Stomatal size and density are negatively correlated at broad phylogenetic scales, such that species with small stomata tend to have greater stomatal density, but the consequences of this relationship for leaf function has been controversial. The prevailing hypothesis posits that the negative scaling of size and density arises because species that evolved higher
            g
            max
            also achieved reduced allocation of epidermal area to stomata (stomatal-area minimization). Alternatively, the negative scaling of size and density might reflect the maintenance of a stable mean and variance in
            g
            max
            despite variation in stomatal size and density, which would result in a higher allocation of epidermal area to achieve high
            g
            max
            (stomatal-area increase). Here, we tested these hypotheses by comparing their predictions for the structure of the covariance of stomatal size and density across species, applying macroevolutionary models and phylogenetic regression to data for 2408 species of angiosperms, gymnosperms, and ferns from forests worldwide. The observed stomatal size-density scaling and covariance supported the stomatal area increase hypothesis for high
            g
            max
            . Thus, contrary to the prevailing view, higher
            g
            max
            is not achieved while minimizing stomatal area allocation but requires increasing epidermal area allocated to stomata. Understanding of optimal stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, and plant water-use efficiency used in Earth System and crop productivity models will thus be improved by including the cost of higher
            g
            max
            both in construction cost of stomata and opportunity cost in epidermal space.},

If three of these parameters are considered at a time, the spectrum of possible shell forms may be shown by a block diagram. Analog and digital computer constructions make it possible to visualize shell forms that are theoretically possible but do not occur in nature. Actual species are not randomly distributed in the total spectrum of theoretically possible forms. Functional and evolutionary groups are confined to discrete regions of the spectum. Rational explanations for several of the observed distributions are apparent and may be expressed in terms of shell function. For example, a bivalve must have non-overlapping whorls in order to have a functional hinge. This fact restricts the geometric range of both brachiopods and bivalved molluscs. Ontogenetic change in coiling geometry may be interpreted as a compensation for the effects of increase in absolute size during growth.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            Lateral diffusion of CO2 was investigated in photosynthesizing leaves with different anatomy by gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence imaging using grease to block stomata. When one-half of the leaf surface of the heterobaric species Helianthus annuus was covered by 4-mm-diameter patches of grease, the response of net CO2 assimilation rate (A) to intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) indicated that higher ambient CO2 concentrations (Ca) caused only limited lateral diffusion into the greased areas. When single 4-mm patches were applied to leaves of heterobaric Phaseolus vulgaris and homobaric Commelina communis, chlorophyll a fluorescence images showed dramatic declines in the quantum efficiency of photosystem II electron transport (measured as Fq′/Fm′) across the patch, demonstrating that lateral CO2 diffusion could not support A. The Fq′/Fm′ values were used to compute images of Ci across patches, and their dependence on Ca was assessed. At high Ca, the patch effect was less in C. communis than P. vulgaris. A finite-volume porous-medium model for assimilation rate and lateral CO2 diffusion was developed to analyze the patch images. The model estimated that the effective lateral CO2 diffusion coefficients inside C. communis and P. vulgaris leaves were 22\% and 12\% of that for free air, respectively. We conclude that, in the light, lateral CO2 diffusion cannot support appreciable photosynthesis over distances of more than approximately 0.3 mm in normal leaves, irrespective of the presence or absence of bundle sheath extensions, because of the CO2 assimilation by cells along the diffusion pathway.},

	abstract = {(1) The relationship of stomatal occurrence (on one or both sides of leaves to environment was studied by literature search, mathematical modelling and investigation of herbarium specimens. The starting hypothesis, that hypostomatous leaves (with stomata only on the underside) should occur in dry habitats, was contradicted by all three sources. (2) The models, based on mass-transfer physics, produced three major results: (a) mesophyll thickness is the chief variable determining stomatal distribution, with thick leaves tending to be amphistomatous (with pores on both sides); (b) stomatal distribution does not depend much on environmental variables, but the dependence is strongest under conditions of low water stress; (c) within the limits of the models, amphistomatous leaves appeared nearly always to be better adapted than hypostomatous leaves, indicating that the models are not yet complete. (3) Leaf thickness and stomatal distribution were determined from herbarium specimens of the Indiana species of Compositae, Liliaceae, Salicaceae and Scrophulariaceae. These measurements were then compared with a simple habitat rating derived for each species from published habitat descriptions. Hypostomatous leaves occurred least often in xeric habitats, most often in mesic ones, and again less often in hydric habitats. However, the data suggest that this relationship is secondary, with leaf thickness being the intervening variable. (4) Finally, explanations are considered for the predominance of hypostomatous leaves over hyperstomatous ones.},

	abstract = {The size and density of stomatal pores limit the maximum rate of leaf carbon gain and water loss ( 
            g 
            max 
            ) in land plants. Stomatal size and density are negatively correlated at broad phylogenetic scales, such that species with small stomata tend to have greater stomatal density, but the consequences of this relationship for leaf function has been controversial. The prevailing hypothesis posits that the negative scaling of size and density arises because species that evolved higher 
            g 
            max 
            also achieved reduced allocation of epidermal area to stomata (stomatal-area minimization). Alternatively, the negative scaling of size and density might reflect the maintenance of a stable mean and variance in 
            g 
            max 
            despite variation in stomatal size and density, which would result in a higher allocation of epidermal area to achieve high 
            g 
            max 
            (stomatal-area increase). Here, we tested these hypotheses by comparing their predictions for the structure of the covariance of stomatal size and density across species, applying macroevolutionary models and phylogenetic regression to data for 2408 species of angiosperms, gymnosperms, and ferns from forests worldwide. The observed stomatal size-density scaling and covariance supported the stomatal area increase hypothesis for high 
            g 
            max 
            . Thus, contrary to the prevailing view, higher 
            g 
            max 
            is not achieved while minimizing stomatal area allocation but requires increasing epidermal area allocated to stomata. Understanding of optimal stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, and plant water-use efficiency used in Earth System and crop productivity models will thus be improved by including the cost of higher 
            g 
            max 
            both in construction cost of stomata and opportunity cost in epidermal space.},

	abstract = {Stomata are turgor-operated valves that control water loss and CO2 uptake during photosynthesis, and thereby water relation and plant biomass accumulation is closely related to stomatal functioning. The aims of this work were to document how stomata are distributed on the leaf surface and to determine if there is any significant variation in stomatal characteristics among Amazonian tree species, and finally to study the relationship between stomatal density (S D) and tree height. Thirty five trees ({\textgreater}17 m tall) of different species were selected. Stomatal type, density (S D), size (S S) and stomatal distribution on the leaf surface were determined using nail polish imprints taken from both leaf surfaces. Irrespective of tree species, stomata were located only on the abaxial surface (hypostomaty), with large variation in both S D and S S among species. S D ranged from 110 mm-2 in Neea altissima to 846 mm-2 in Qualea acuminata. However, in most species S D ranges between 271 and 543 mm-2, with a negative relationship between S D and S S. We also found a positive relationship between S D and tree height (r² = 0.14, p {\textless} 0.01), but no correlation was found between S D and leaf thickness. The most common stomatal type was anomocytic (37\%), followed by paracytic (26\%) and anisocytic (11\%). We conclude that in Amazonian tree species, stomatal distribution on the leaf surface is a response most likely dependent on the genetic background of every species, rather than a reaction to environmental changes, and that somehow S D is influenced by environmental factors dependent on tree height.

            Estômatos são válvulas operadas a turgor que controlam a perda de água e a captura de CO2 durante a fotossíntese. Assim, as relações hídricas e o acumulo de biomassa vegetal são fortemente influenciadas pelo funcionamento estomático. Os objetivos deste trabalho foram: documentar como os estômatos estão distribuídos na superfície foliar e determinar se existe variação das características estomáticas entre espécies da Amazônia, estudar a relação entre densidade estomática (S D) e altura arbórea. Trinta e cinco árvores ({\textgreater}17 m de altura) de diferentes espécies foram selecionadas. Tipo de complexo estomático, S D, tamanho (S S) e distribuição na superfície foliar foram determinados utilizando impressões de ambas as superfícies foliares com esmalte incolor. Independente da espécie, os estômatos foram encontrados apenas na superfície abaxial (hipoestomatia) com ampla variação na S D e no S S entre espécies. A densidade estomática variou de 110 mm-2 em Neea altissima a 846 mm-2 em Qualea acuminata. Entretanto, a maioria das espécies apresentou S D entre 271 e 543 mm-2, com uma relação negativa entre S D e S S. Observou-se uma relação positiva entre S D e altura arbórea (r² = 0.14, p {\textless} 0.01), não havendo relação entre S D e espessura foliar. Os tipos estomáticos mais comuns foram: anomocíticos (37\%), seguidos de paracíticos (26\%) e anisocíticos (11\%). Concluiu-se que em espécies da Amazônia, a distribuição de estômatos na superfície foliar está mais relacionada a fatores genéticos de cada espécie do que a variações ambientais. Entretanto, S D é fortemente influenciada por fatores ambientais concernentes à altura da árvore.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            Stomatal responses to changes in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) constitute the predominant form of daytime gas-exchange regulation in plants. Stomatal closure in response to increased VPD is driven by the rapid up-regulation of foliar abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis and ABA levels in angiosperms; however, very little is known about the physiological trigger for this increase in ABA biosynthesis at increased VPD. Using a novel method of modifying leaf cell turgor by the application of external pressures, we test whether changes in turgor pressure can trigger increases in foliar ABA levels over 20 min, a period of time most relevant to the stomatal response to VPD. We found in angiosperm species that the biosynthesis of ABA was triggered by reductions in leaf turgor, and in two species tested, that a higher sensitivity of ABA synthesis to leaf turgor corresponded with a higher stomatal sensitivity to VPD. In contrast, representative species from nonflowering plant lineages did not show a rapid turgor-triggered increase in foliar ABA levels, which is consistent with previous studies demonstrating passive stomatal responses to changes in VPD in these lineages. Our method provides a new tool for characterizing the response of stomata to water availability.},

            Given that stomatal movement is ultimately a mechanical process and that stomata are morphologically and mechanically diverse, we explored the influence of stomatal mechanical diversity on leaf gas exchange and considered some of the constraints. Mechanical measurements were conducted on the guard cells of four different species exhibiting different stomatal morphologies, including three variants on the classical “kidney” form and one “dumb-bell” type; this information, together with gas-exchange measurements, was used to model and compare their respective operational characteristics. Based on evidence from scanning electron microscope images of cryo-sectioned leaves that were sampled under full sun and high humidity and from pressure probe measurements of the stomatal aperture versus guard cell turgor relationship at maximum and zero epidermal turgor, it was concluded that maximum stomatal apertures (and maximum leaf diffusive conductance) could not be obtained in at least one of the species (the grass Triticum aestivum) without a substantial reduction in subsidiary cell osmotic (and hence turgor) pressure during stomatal opening to overcome the large mechanical advantage of subsidiary cells. A mechanism for this is proposed, with a corollary being greatly accelerated stomatal opening and closure. Gas-exchange measurements on T. aestivum revealed the capability of very rapid stomatal movements, which may be explained by the unique morphology and mechanics of its dumb-bell-shaped stomata coupled with “see-sawing” of osmotic and turgor pressure between guard and subsidiary cells during stomatal opening or closure. Such properties might underlie the success of grasses.},

Mosses and hornworts are the earliest among extant land plants to have stomata, but unlike those in all other plants, bryophyte stomata are located exclusively on the sporangium of the sporophyte. Liverworts are the only group of plants that are entirely devoid of stomata. Stomata on leaves and stems of tracheophytes are involved in gas exchange and water transport. The function of stomata in bryophytes is highly debated and differs from that in tracheophytes in that they have been implicated in drying and dehiscence of the sporangium. Over the past decade, anatomical, physiological, developmental, and molecular studies have provided new insights on the function of stomata in bryophytes. In this review, we synthesize the contributions of these studies and provide new data on bryophyte stomata. We evaluate the potential role of stomata in moss and hornwort life histories and we identify areas that will provide valuable data in ascertaining the evolutionary history and function of stomata across land plants.},

CO2 assimilation rate and stomatal conductance of over-expressers and the sdd1-1 mutant were unchanged compared with wild types when measured under the light conditions the plants were exposed to during growth. Lower stomatal density was compensated for by increased stomatal aperture and conversely, increased stomatal density was compensated for by reduced stomatal aperture. At high light intensities the assimilation rates and stomatal conductance of SDD1 over-expressers were reduced to 80\% of those in wild type plants. Areas beneath stomata and patches lacking stomata were analysed separately. In areas without stomata, maximum fluorescence yield (Fv / Fm) and quantum yield of photosystem II (Φ PSII) were significantly lower than in areas beneath stomata. In areas beneath stomata, Fv / Fm and Φ PSII were identical to levels measured in wild type leaves. At high light intensities over-expressers showed decreased photochemical quenching (qP) compared with wild types. However, the decrease of qP was significantly stronger in areas without stomata than in mesophyll areas beneath stomata. At high CO2 partial pressures and high light intensities CO2 assimilation rates of SDD1 over-expressers did not reach wild type levels. These results indicate that photosynthesis in SDD1 over-expressers was reduced because of limiting CO2 in areas furthest from stomata at high light.},

The presence of stomata on both leaf surfaces, termed amphistomy, increases photosynthetic rate, is common in plants from high light habitats, and rare otherwise. In this study I use optimality models based on leaf energy budget and photosynthetic models to ask why amphistomy is common in high light habitats. I developed an R package leafoptimizer to solve for stomatal traits that optimally balance carbon gain with water loss in a given environment. The model predicts that amphistomy is common in high light because its marginal effect on carbon gain is greater than in the shade, but only if the costs of amphistomy are also lower under high light than in the shade. More generally, covariation between costs and benefits may explain why stomatal and other traits form discrete phenotypic clusters.},

According to the characters and distributional pattern, two different types of stomatal clusters were identified, However, calculation of R-values in 16 different plant species showed that the classical method in spatial ecology study could not distinguish between these two types of clusters. Therefore, to classify them, the term "contiguous cluster" and "non-contiguous cluster" were introduced. Their formation and ecological significance were also discussed. In order to study whether stomatal clustering occurs in response to the environment, Vicia faba L. were cultivated under different water/salinity levels. Epidermis bioassay was conducted 2 weeks after the treatment. The results showed that drought and salt stresses significantly increased the stomatal density and stomatal index. More importantly, the occurrences of contiguous stomatal clustering also raised along the drought/salt gradients. The result suggests that the stomatal clustering is correlated with environmental signals. It could serve as a new marker for environmental adaptation in terrestrial plants.},

              The question of how many species of 
              Fungi 
              there are has occasioned much speculation, with figures mostly posited from around half a million to 10 million, and in one extreme case even a sizable portion of the spectacular number of 1 trillion. Here we examine new evidence from various sources to derive an updated estimate of global fungal diversity. The rates and patterns in the description of new species from the 1750s show no sign of approaching an asymptote and even accelerated in the 2010s after the advent of molecular approaches to species delimitation. Species recognition studies of (semi-)cryptic species hidden in morpho-species complexes suggest a weighted average ratio of about an order of magnitude for the number of species recognized after and before such studies. New evidence also comes from extrapolations of plant:fungus ratios, with information now being generated from environmental sequence studies, including comparisons of molecular and fieldwork data from the same sites. We further draw attention to undescribed species awaiting discovery in biodiversity hot spots in the tropics, little-explored habitats (such as lichen-inhabiting fungi), and material in collections awaiting study. We conclude that the commonly cited estimate of 1.5 million species is conservative and that the actual range is properly estimated at 2.2 to 3.8 million. With 120,000 currently accepted species, it appears that at best just 8\%, and in the worst case scenario just 3\%, are named so far. Improved estimates hinge particularly on reliable statistical and phylogenetic approaches to analyze the rapidly increasing amount of environmental sequence data.},

However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the ≈550 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (≈450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals (≈2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria (≈70 Gt C) and archaea (≈7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that terrestrial biomass is about two orders of magnitude higher than marine biomass and estimate a total of ≈6 Gt C of marine biota, doubling the previous estimated quantity. Our analysis reveals that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants.},

Computer simulations of three-dimensional branching patterns are presented as top and side views. Changing parameters result in variations of tree form which would be useful to foresters and horticulturists in selecting seedlings. Simulations of leaf surface area show that rules limiting bifurcation in the model increase the effective surface area per leaf whorl and per combined leaf surface in lateral branches (= smaller leaf area index). However, unrestricted bifurcation results in larger values of total effective and combined leaf surface areas in equivalent branches and in a larger leaf area index. Simulations should also be useful in examining the effects of different parameters and rules upon leaf surface area and reproductive sites.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Phenotypic convergence, the independent evolution of similar traits, is ubiquitous in nature, happening at all levels of biological organizations and in most kinds of living beings. Uncovering its mechanisms remains a fundamental goal in biology. Evolutionary theory considers that convergence emerges through independent genetic changes selected over long periods of time. We show in this study that convergence can also arise through phenotypic plasticity. We illustrate this idea by investigating how plasticity drives \textit{Moricandia arvensis}, a mustard species displaying within-individual polyphenism in flowers, across the morphological space of the entire Brassicaceae family. By compiling the multidimensional floral phenotype, the phylogenetic relationships, and the pollination niche of over 3000 Brassicaceae species, we demonstrated that \textit{Moricandia arvensis} exhibits a plastic-mediated within-individual floral disparity greater than that found not only between species but also between higher taxonomical levels such as genera and tribes. As a consequence of this divergence, \textit{M. arvensis} moves outside the morphospace region occupied by its ancestors and close relatives, crosses into a new region where it encounters a different pollination niche and converges phenotypically with distant Brassicaceae lineages. Our study suggests that, by inducing phenotypes that explore simultaneously different regions of the morphological space, plasticity triggers rapid phenotypic convergence.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The two main assembly processes claimed to structure plant communities are habitat filtering and competitive interactions. The set of species growing in fire-prone communities has been filtered in such a way that species without fire-persistence traits have not successfully entered the community. Because plant traits are evolutionarily conserved and fire traits are correlated with other plant traits, communities under high fire frequency should not include all possible trait combinations, and thus the morphospace occupation by species in these communities should be lower than expected by chance (underoccupied). In contrast, communities under low fire frequency would lack the filtering factor, and thus their underoccupation of the morphospace is not expected. We test this prediction by comparing the morphospace occupation by species in communities located in the western Mediterranean Basin, five of them subject to high fire frequency (HiFi) and four to low fire frequency (LowFi). We first compile a set of morphological and functional traits for the species growing on the nine sites, then we compute the morphospace occupation of each site as a convex hull volume, and finally, to assert that our results are not a product of a random branching pattern of evolution, we simulate our traits under a null model of neutral evolution and compare the morphospace occupation of the simulated traits with the results from the empirical data. The results suggest that, as predicted, there is a clear differential morphospace occupation between communities under different fire regimes in such a way that the morphospace is underoccupied in HiFi communities only. The simulation of a neutral evolutionary model does not replicate the observed pattern of differential morphospace occupation, and thus it should be attributed to assembly processes. In conclusion, our results suggest that fire is a strong community assembling process, filtering the species that have fire-persistent traits and thus assembling phenotypically and phylogenetically clustered communities with vacant zones in the morphospace.},

	abstract = {Whole-genome duplication (WGD) has occurred commonly in land plant evolution and it is often invoked as a causal agent in diversification, phenotypic and developmental innovation, as well as conferring extinction resistance. The ancient and iconic lineage of 
              Equisetum 
              is no exception, where WGD has been inferred to have occurred prior to the Cretaceous–Palaeogene (K–Pg) boundary, coincident with WGD events in angiosperms. In the absence of high species diversity, WGD in 
              Equisetum 
              is interpreted to have facilitated the long-term survival of the lineage. However, this characterization remains uncertain as these analyses of the 
              Equisetum 
              WGD event have not accounted for fossil diversity. Here, we analyse additional available transcriptomes and summarize the fossil record. Our results confirm support for at least one WGD event shared among the majority of extant 
              Equisetum 
              species. Furthermore, we use improved dating methods to constrain the age of gene duplication in geological time and identify two successive 
              Equisetum 
              WGD events. The two WGD events occurred during the Carboniferous and Triassic, respectively, rather than in association with the K–Pg boundary. WGD events are believed to drive high rates of trait evolution and innovations, but analysed trends of morphological evolution across the historical diversity of 
              Equisetum 
              provide little evidence for further macroevolutionary consequences following WGD. WGD events cannot have conferred extinction resistance to the 
              Equisetum 
              lineage through the K–Pg boundary since the ploidy events occurred hundreds of millions of years before this mass extinction and we find evidence of extinction among fossil polyploid 
              Equisetum 
              lineages. Our findings precipitate the need for a review of the proposed roles of WGDs in biological innovation and extinction survival in angiosperm and non-angiosperm lineages alike.},

	abstract = {We used a colour-space model of avian vision to assess whether a distinctive bird pollination syndrome exists for floral colour among Australian angiosperms. We also used a novel phylogenetically based method to assess whether such a syndrome represents a significant degree of convergent evolution. About half of the 80 species in our sample that attract nectarivorous birds had floral colours in a small, isolated region of colour space characterized by an emphasis on long-wavelength reflection. The distinctiveness of this ‘red arm’ region was much greater when colours were modelled for violet-sensitive (VS) avian vision than for the ultraviolet-sensitive visual system. Honeyeaters (Meliphagidae) are the dominant avian nectarivores in Australia and have VS vision. Ancestral state reconstructions suggest that 31 lineages evolved into the red arm region, whereas simulations indicate that an average of five or six lineages and a maximum of 22 are likely to have entered in the absence of selection. Thus, significant evolutionary convergence on a distinctive floral colour syndrome for bird pollination has occurred in Australia, although only a subset of bird-pollinated taxa belongs to this syndrome. The visual system of honeyeaters has been the apparent driver of this convergence.},

A computer model based on that of Niklas and Kerchner (1984) was used to generate S. europaea-like branching patterns. The model was used to predict the morphology of S. europaea that could maximize light interception and minimize the total bending moment. The optimal branching pattern generated by the computer corresponded very closely to the form of S. europaea found in late-successional populations. The progression of model forms from the least efficient (lowest total projected surface area and highest bending moment) to the most efficient (highest projected surface area and lowest bending moment) parallels the observed phenotypic changes in morphology of S europaea over the course of succession in New England salt marshes. Based on computer simulations, we conclude that morphological changes in the branching patterns of S. europaea during succession correspond to alterations of shape capable of coincidentally maximizing the interception of light and minimizing the total bending moment.},

	abstract = {Angiosperms (flowering plants) are strikingly diverse. This is clearly expressed in the morphology of their pollen grains, which are characterized by enormous variety in their shape and patterning. In this paper, I approach angiosperm pollen morphology from the perspective of enumerative combinatorics. This involves generating angiosperm pollen morphotypes by algorithmically combining character states and enumerating the results of these combinations. I use this approach to generate 3 643 200 pollen morphotypes, which I visualize using a parallel-coordinates plot. This represents a raw morphospace. To compare real-world and theoretical morphologies, I map the pollen of 1008 species of Neotropical angiosperms growing on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, onto this raw morphospace. This highlights that, in addition to their well-documented taxonomic diversity, Neotropical rainforests also represent an enormous reservoir of morphological diversity. Angiosperm pollen morphospace at BCI has been filled mostly by pollen morphotypes that are unique to single plant species. Repetition of pollen morphotypes among higher taxa at BCI reflects both constraint and convergence. This combinatorial approach to morphology addresses the complexity that results from large numbers of discrete character combinations and could be employed in any situation where organismal form can be captured by discrete morphological characters.},

A principal coordinate analysis of 641 leaf species from North American and European floras ranging in age from Middle Devonian through the end of the Permian shows that the clades followed parallel trajectories of evolution: each clade exhibits rapid radiation of leaf morphologies from simple (and similar) forms in the Late Devonian/Early Carboniferous to diverse, differentiated leaf forms, with strong constraint on further diversification beginning in the mid Carboniferous. Similar morphospace trajectories have been documented in studies of morphological evolution in animals; however, plant fossils present unique opportunities for understanding the developmental processes that underlie such patterns. Detailed comparison of venation in Paleozoic leaves with that of modern leaves for which developmental mechanisms are known suggests developmental interpretations for the origination and early evolution of leaves. The parallel evolution of a marginal meristem by the modification of developmental mechanisms available in the common ancestor of all groups resulted in the pattern of leaf evolution repeated by each clade. Early steps of leaf evolution were followed by constraint on further diversification as the possible elaborations of marginal growth were exhausted. Hypotheses of development in Paleozoic leaves can be tested by the study of living plants with analogous leaf morphologies.},

The resulting simulated adaptive walks indicate that early tracheophyte evolution involved optimizing the performance of many tasks simultaneously rather than maximizing the performance of one or only a few tasks individually, and that the requirement for optimization accelerated the tempo of morphological evolution in the Silurian and Devonian.},

	abstract = {The Cretaceous angiosperm radiation offers an opportunity to examine patterns of morphological evolution in terrestrial plants and to compare them with patterns previously observed during radiations of marine animals. Focusing on evolution among angiosperm pollen types, I used average pairwise dissimilarity and total variance to describe changing morphological varieties (disparity) through the Cretaceous and Paleocene in North America. Angiosperm species diversity shows an approximately tenfold increase through this interval, but this taxonomic diversification is not matched by a comparable change in morphological disparity. Partitioning of morphological disparity among major pollen groups shows that most of the variance is contributed by eudicots from the Albian onwards. Constant disparity across the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary despite decreased taxonomic diversity suggests that the Cretaceous/Tertiary extinction was not selective with respect to the pollen morphological characters analyzed here. The two measures of disparity show similar patterns. The overall pattern is robust to changes in character weighting, indicating that no one set of characters or weighting scheme is driving the pattern. Analyses of older data indicate that the initial burst of disparity in the Aptian could be due in part to analytical time-averaging. The observed incongruence between taxonomic diversity and morphological disparity suggests that morphological evolution in pollen was characterized by larger jumps early and smaller jumps later on, and is similar to that found in several groups of marine invertebrates.},

However, the quantitative distribution of floral morphological diversity (disparity) among lineages and the relative contribution of functional modules (perianth, androecium and gynoecium) to total floral disparity have rarely been addressed. Focusing on a major angiosperm order (Ericales), we compiled a dataset of 37 floral traits scored for 381 extant species and nine fossils. We conducted morphospace analyses to explore phylogenetic, temporal and functional patterns of disparity. We found that the floral morphospace is organized as a continuous cloud in which most clades occupy distinct regions in a mosaic pattern, that disparity increases with clade size rather than age, and that fossils fall in a narrow portion of the space. Surprisingly, our study also revealed that among functional modules, it is the androecium that contributes most to total floral disparity in Ericales. We discuss our findings in the light of clade history, selective regimes as well as developmental and functional constraints acting on the evolution of the flower and thereby demonstrate that quantitative analyses such as the ones used here are a powerful tool to gain novel insights into the evolution and diversity of flowers.},

            Adaptive radiation is the rise of a diversity of ecological roles and role‐specific adaptations within a lineage. Recently, some researchers have begun to use ‘adaptive radiation’ or ‘radiation’ as synonymous with ‘explosive species diversification’. This essay aims to clarify distinctions between these concepts, and the related ideas of geographic speciation, sexual selection, key innovations, key landscapes and ecological keys. Several examples are given to demonstrate that adaptive radiation and explosive diversification are not the same phenomenon, and that focusing on explosive diversification and the analysis of phylogenetic topology ignores much of the rich biology associated with adaptive radiation, and risks generating confusion about the nature of the evolutionary forces driving species diversification. Some ‘radiations’ involve bursts of geographic speciation or sexual selection, rather than adaptive diversification; some adaptive radiations have little or no effect on speciation, or even a negative effect. Many classic examples of ‘adaptive radiation’ appear to involve effects driven partly by geographic speciation, species’ dispersal abilities, and the nature of extrinsic dispersal barriers; partly by sexual selection; and partly by adaptive radiation in the classical sense, including the origin of traits and invasion of adaptive zones that result in decreased diversification rates but add to overall diversity.},

              Background
              Despite the wide spread application of confocal and multiphoton laser scanning microscopy in plant biology, leaf phenotype assessment still relies on two-dimensional imaging with a limited appreciation of the cells' structural context and an inherent inaccuracy of cell measurements. Here, a successful procedure for the three-dimensional imaging and analysis of plant leaves is presented.
            
            
              Results
              
                The procedure was developed based on a range of developmental stages, from leaf initiation to senescence, of soil-grown
                Arabidopsis thaliana
                (L.) Heynh. Rigorous clearing of tissues, made possible by enhanced leaf permeability to clearing agents, allowed the optical sectioning of the entire leaf thickness by both confocal and multiphoton microscopy. The superior image quality, in resolution and contrast, obtained by the latter technique enabled the three-dimensional visualisation of leaf morphology at the individual cell level, cell segmentation and the construction of structural models. Image analysis macros were developed to measure leaf thickness and tissue proportions, as well as to determine for the epidermis and all layers of mesophyll tissue, cell density, volume, length and width. For mesophyll tissue, the proportion of intercellular spaces and the surface areas of cells were also estimated. The performance of the procedure was demonstrated for the expanding 6
                th
                leaf of the Arabidopsis rosette. Furthermore, it was proven to be effective for leaves of another dicotyledon, apple (
                Malus domestica
                Borkh.), which has a very different cellular organisation.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              The pipeline for the three-dimensional imaging and analysis of plant leaves provides the means to include variables on internal tissues in leaf growth studies and the assessment of leaf phenotypes. It also allows the visualisation and quantification of alterations in leaf structure alongside changes in leaf functioning observed under environmental constraints. Data obtained using this procedure can further be integrated in leaf development and functioning models.},

                  Stomata are simultaneously tasked with permitting the uptake of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis while limiting water loss from the plant. This process is mainly regulated by guard cell control of the stomatal aperture, but recent advancements have highlighted the importance of several genes that control stomatal development.
                
                
                  
                    Using targeted genetic manipulations of the stomatal lineage and a combination of gas exchange and microscopy techniques, we show that changes in stomatal development of the epidermal layer lead to coupled changes in the underlying mesophyll tissues. This coordinated response tends to match leaf photosynthetic potential (
                    V
                    cmax
                    ) with gas‐exchange capacity (
                    g
                    smax
                    ), and hence the uptake of carbon dioxide for water lost.
                  
                
                
                  We found that different genetic regulators systematically altered tissue coordination in separate ways: the transcription factor SPEECHLESS (SPCH) primarily affected leaf size and thickness, whereas peptides in the EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR (EPF) family altered cell density in the mesophyll. It was also determined that interlayer coordination required the cell‐surface receptor TOO MANY MOUTHS (TMM).
                
                
                  These results demonstrate that stomata‐specific regulators can alter mesophyll properties, which provides insight into how molecular pathways can organize leaf tissues to coordinate gas exchange and suggests new strategies for improving plant water‐use efficiency.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Lateral diffusion of CO2 was investigated in photosynthesizing leaves with different anatomy by gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence imaging using grease to block stomata. When one-half of the leaf surface of the heterobaric species Helianthus annuus was covered by 4-mm-diameter patches of grease, the response of net CO2 assimilation rate (A) to intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) indicated that higher ambient CO2 concentrations (Ca) caused only limited lateral diffusion into the greased areas. When single 4-mm patches were applied to leaves of heterobaric Phaseolus vulgaris and homobaric Commelina communis, chlorophyll a fluorescence images showed dramatic declines in the quantum efficiency of photosystem II electron transport (measured as Fq′/Fm′) across the patch, demonstrating that lateral CO2 diffusion could not support A. The Fq′/Fm′ values were used to compute images of Ci across patches, and their dependence on Ca was assessed. At high Ca, the patch effect was less in C. communis than P. vulgaris. A finite-volume porous-medium model for assimilation rate and lateral CO2 diffusion was developed to analyze the patch images. The model estimated that the effective lateral CO2 diffusion coefficients inside C. communis and P. vulgaris leaves were 22\% and 12\% of that for free air, respectively. We conclude that, in the light, lateral CO2 diffusion cannot support appreciable photosynthesis over distances of more than approximately 0.3 mm in normal leaves, irrespective of the presence or absence of bundle sheath extensions, because of the CO2 assimilation by cells along the diffusion pathway.},

	abstract = {CO2 faces a series of resistances while diffusing between the substomatal cavities and the sites of carboxylation within chloroplasts. The absence of techniques to measure the resistance of individual steps makes it difﬁcult to deﬁne their relative importance. Resistance to diffusion through intercellular airspace differs between leaves, but is usually of minor importance. Leaves with high photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf area reduce mesophyll resistance by increasing the surface area of chloroplasts exposed to intercellular airspace per unit leaf area, Sc. Cell walls impose a signiﬁcant resistance. Assuming an effective porosity of the cell wall of 0.1 or 0.05, then cell walls could account for 25\% or 50\% of the total mesophyll resistance, respectively. Since the fraction of apoplastic water that is unbound and available for unhindered CO2 diffusion is unknown, it is possible that the effective porosity is {\textless}0.05. Effective porosity could also vary in response to changes in pH or cation concentration. Consequently, cell walls could account for {\textgreater}50\% of the total resistance and a variable proportion. Most of the remaining resistance is imposed by one or more of the three membranes as mesophyll resistance can be altered by varying the expression of cooporins. The CO2 permeability of vesicles prepared from chloroplast envelopes has been reduced by RNA interference (RNAi) expression of NtAQP1, but not those prepared from the plasma membrane. Carbonic anhydrase activity also inﬂuences mesophyll resistance. Mesophyll resistance is relatively insensitive to the manipulation of any step in the pathway because it represents only part of the total and may also be countered by pleiotropic compensatory changes. The parameters in greatest need of additional measurements are Sc, mesophyll cell wall thickness, and the permeabilities of the plasma membrane and chloroplast envelope.},

	abstract = {The main route for CO2 and water vapor exchange between a plant and the environment is through small pores called stomata. The accessibility of stomata and predictable division series that characterize their development provides an excellent system to address fundamental questions in biology. Stomatal cell-state transition and specification are regulated by a suite of transcription factors controlled by positional signaling via peptide ligands and transmembrane receptors. Downstream effectors include several members of the core cell-cycle genes. Environmentally induced signals are integrated into this essential developmental program to modulate stomatal development or function in response to changes in the abiotic environment. In addition, the recent identification of premitotic polarly localized proteins from both Arabidopsis and maize has laid a foundation for the future understanding of intrinsic cell polarity in plants. This review highlights the mechanisms of stomatal development through characterization of genes controlling cell-fate specification, cell polarity, cell division, and cell-cell communication during stomatal development and discusses the genetic framework linking these molecular processes with the correct spacing, density, and differentiation of stomata.},

	abstract = {• The observation that stomatal density (number mm−2) on herbarium leaves had decreased over the last century represents clear evidence that plants have responded to anthropogenic increases in CO2 concentration. The mechanism of the response has proved elusive but here it is shown that density responses to both CO2 concentration and humidity are correlated with changes in whole-plant transpiration and leaf abscisic acid (ABA) concentration. • The transpiration rate of a range of accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana was manipulated by changing CO2 concentration, humidity and by exogenous application of ABA. Stomatal density increased with transpiration and leaf ABA concentration. • A common property of signal transduction systems is that they rapidly lose their ability to respond to the co-associated stimulus. Pathways of water movement within the plant are connected and so variations in supply and demand can be signalled throughout the plant directly, modifying stomatal aperture of mature leaves and stomatal density of developing leaves. Furthermore, the system identified here does not conform to the loss of ability to respond. • A putative mechanism is proposed for the control of stomatal density by transpiration rate and leaf ABA concentration.},

As both tissues come with attendant costs, it would be expected that the synthesis and spacing of leaf veins and stomata should be coordinated in a way that maximizes benefit to the plant. We propose an innovative geoprocessing method based on image editing and a geographic information system to study the quantitative relationships between vein and stomatal spatial patterns on leaves collected from 31 angiosperm species from different biomes. The number of stomata within each areole was linearly related to the length of the looping vein contour. As a consequence of the presence of free-ending veinlets, the minimum mean distance of stomata from the nearest veins was invariant with areole size in most of the species, and species with smaller distances carried a higher density of stomata. Uniformity of spatial patterning was consistent within leaves and species. Our results demonstrate the existence of an optimal spatial organization of veins and stomata, and suggest their interplay as a key feature for achieving a constant mesophyll hydraulic resistance throughout the leaf.},

The mechanisms that determine the distribution of stomata in the epidermis have been studied extensively, but how this relates to the regulation of mesophyll airspace configuration is poorly understood. Recent studies have investigated how development is coordinated between these tissue layers. The evidence suggests that multiple mechanisms are likely to work concurrently to coordinate stomatal and mesophyll development for optimal leaf gas exchange, and that both genetic and physiological factors contribute to this regulation. Such advances in our understanding of leaf development have important implications for potential improvement of crop water use efficiency.},
