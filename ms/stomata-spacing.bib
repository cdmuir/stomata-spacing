            Lateral diffusion of CO2 was investigated in photosynthesizing leaves with different anatomy by gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence imaging using grease to block stomata. When one-half of the leaf surface of the heterobaric species Helianthus annuus was covered by 4-mm-diameter patches of grease, the response of net CO2 assimilation rate (A) to intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) indicated that higher ambient CO2 concentrations (Ca) caused only limited lateral diffusion into the greased areas. When single 4-mm patches were applied to leaves of heterobaric Phaseolus vulgaris and homobaric Commelina communis, chlorophyll a fluorescence images showed dramatic declines in the quantum efficiency of photosystem II electron transport (measured as Fq′/Fm′) across the patch, demonstrating that lateral CO2 diffusion could not support A. The Fq′/Fm′ values were used to compute images of Ci across patches, and their dependence on Ca was assessed. At high Ca, the patch effect was less in C. communis than P. vulgaris. A finite-volume porous-medium model for assimilation rate and lateral CO2 diffusion was developed to analyze the patch images. The model estimated that the effective lateral CO2 diffusion coefficients inside C. communis and P. vulgaris leaves were 22\% and 12\% of that for free air, respectively. We conclude that, in the light, lateral CO2 diffusion cannot support appreciable photosynthesis over distances of more than approximately 0.3 mm in normal leaves, irrespective of the presence or absence of bundle sheath extensions, because of the CO2 assimilation by cells along the diffusion pathway.},

	abstract = {(1) The relationship of stomatal occurrence (on one or both sides of leaves to environment was studied by literature search, mathematical modelling and investigation of herbarium specimens. The starting hypothesis, that hypostomatous leaves (with stomata only on the underside) should occur in dry habitats, was contradicted by all three sources. (2) The models, based on mass-transfer physics, produced three major results: (a) mesophyll thickness is the chief variable determining stomatal distribution, with thick leaves tending to be amphistomatous (with pores on both sides); (b) stomatal distribution does not depend much on environmental variables, but the dependence is strongest under conditions of low water stress; (c) within the limits of the models, amphistomatous leaves appeared nearly always to be better adapted than hypostomatous leaves, indicating that the models are not yet complete. (3) Leaf thickness and stomatal distribution were determined from herbarium specimens of the Indiana species of Compositae, Liliaceae, Salicaceae and Scrophulariaceae. These measurements were then compared with a simple habitat rating derived for each species from published habitat descriptions. Hypostomatous leaves occurred least often in xeric habitats, most often in mesic ones, and again less often in hydric habitats. However, the data suggest that this relationship is secondary, with leaf thickness being the intervening variable. (4) Finally, explanations are considered for the predominance of hypostomatous leaves over hyperstomatous ones.},

	abstract = {The size and density of stomatal pores limit the maximum rate of leaf carbon gain and water loss ( 
            g 
            max 
            ) in land plants. Stomatal size and density are negatively correlated at broad phylogenetic scales, such that species with small stomata tend to have greater stomatal density, but the consequences of this relationship for leaf function has been controversial. The prevailing hypothesis posits that the negative scaling of size and density arises because species that evolved higher 
            g 
            max 
            also achieved reduced allocation of epidermal area to stomata (stomatal-area minimization). Alternatively, the negative scaling of size and density might reflect the maintenance of a stable mean and variance in 
            g 
            max 
            despite variation in stomatal size and density, which would result in a higher allocation of epidermal area to achieve high 
            g 
            max 
            (stomatal-area increase). Here, we tested these hypotheses by comparing their predictions for the structure of the covariance of stomatal size and density across species, applying macroevolutionary models and phylogenetic regression to data for 2408 species of angiosperms, gymnosperms, and ferns from forests worldwide. The observed stomatal size-density scaling and covariance supported the stomatal area increase hypothesis for high 
            g 
            max 
            . Thus, contrary to the prevailing view, higher 
            g 
            max 
            is not achieved while minimizing stomatal area allocation but requires increasing epidermal area allocated to stomata. Understanding of optimal stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, and plant water-use efficiency used in Earth System and crop productivity models will thus be improved by including the cost of higher 
            g 
            max

	abstract = {Stomata are turgor-operated valves that control water loss and CO2 uptake during photosynthesis, and thereby water relation and plant biomass accumulation is closely related to stomatal functioning. The aims of this work were to document how stomata are distributed on the leaf surface and to determine if there is any significant variation in stomatal characteristics among Amazonian tree species, and finally to study the relationship between stomatal density (S D) and tree height. Thirty five trees ({\textgreater}17 m tall) of different species were selected. Stomatal type, density (S D), size (S S) and stomatal distribution on the leaf surface were determined using nail polish imprints taken from both leaf surfaces. Irrespective of tree species, stomata were located only on the abaxial surface (hypostomaty), with large variation in both S D and S S among species. S D ranged from 110 mm-2 in Neea altissima to 846 mm-2 in Qualea acuminata. However, in most species S D ranges between 271 and 543 mm-2, with a negative relationship between S D and S S. We also found a positive relationship between S D and tree height (r² = 0.14, p {\textless} 0.01), but no correlation was found between S D and leaf thickness. The most common stomatal type was anomocytic (37\%), followed by paracytic (26\%) and anisocytic (11\%). We conclude that in Amazonian tree species, stomatal distribution on the leaf surface is a response most likely dependent on the genetic background of every species, rather than a reaction to environmental changes, and that somehow S D is influenced by environmental factors dependent on tree height.

            Estômatos são válvulas operadas a turgor que controlam a perda de água e a captura de CO2 durante a fotossíntese. Assim, as relações hídricas e o acumulo de biomassa vegetal são fortemente influenciadas pelo funcionamento estomático. Os objetivos deste trabalho foram: documentar como os estômatos estão distribuídos na superfície foliar e determinar se existe variação das características estomáticas entre espécies da Amazônia, estudar a relação entre densidade estomática (S D) e altura arbórea. Trinta e cinco árvores ({\textgreater}17 m de altura) de diferentes espécies foram selecionadas. Tipo de complexo estomático, S D, tamanho (S S) e distribuição na superfície foliar foram determinados utilizando impressões de ambas as superfícies foliares com esmalte incolor. Independente da espécie, os estômatos foram encontrados apenas na superfície abaxial (hipoestomatia) com ampla variação na S D e no S S entre espécies. A densidade estomática variou de 110 mm-2 em Neea altissima a 846 mm-2 em Qualea acuminata. Entretanto, a maioria das espécies apresentou S D entre 271 e 543 mm-2, com uma relação negativa entre S D e S S. Observou-se uma relação positiva entre S D e altura arbórea (r² = 0.14, p {\textless} 0.01), não havendo relação entre S D e espessura foliar. Os tipos estomáticos mais comuns foram: anomocíticos (37\%), seguidos de paracíticos (26\%) e anisocíticos (11\%). Concluiu-se que em espécies da Amazônia, a distribuição de estômatos na superfície foliar está mais relacionada a fatores genéticos de cada espécie do que a variações ambientais. Entretanto, S D é fortemente influenciada por fatores ambientais concernentes à altura da árvore.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            Stomatal responses to changes in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) constitute the predominant form of daytime gas-exchange regulation in plants. Stomatal closure in response to increased VPD is driven by the rapid up-regulation of foliar abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis and ABA levels in angiosperms; however, very little is known about the physiological trigger for this increase in ABA biosynthesis at increased VPD. Using a novel method of modifying leaf cell turgor by the application of external pressures, we test whether changes in turgor pressure can trigger increases in foliar ABA levels over 20 min, a period of time most relevant to the stomatal response to VPD. We found in angiosperm species that the biosynthesis of ABA was triggered by reductions in leaf turgor, and in two species tested, that a higher sensitivity of ABA synthesis to leaf turgor corresponded with a higher stomatal sensitivity to VPD. In contrast, representative species from nonflowering plant lineages did not show a rapid turgor-triggered increase in foliar ABA levels, which is consistent with previous studies demonstrating passive stomatal responses to changes in VPD in these lineages. Our method provides a new tool for characterizing the response of stomata to water availability.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            Given that stomatal movement is ultimately a mechanical process and that stomata are morphologically and mechanically diverse, we explored the influence of stomatal mechanical diversity on leaf gas exchange and considered some of the constraints. Mechanical measurements were conducted on the guard cells of four different species exhibiting different stomatal morphologies, including three variants on the classical “kidney” form and one “dumb-bell” type; this information, together with gas-exchange measurements, was used to model and compare their respective operational characteristics. Based on evidence from scanning electron microscope images of cryo-sectioned leaves that were sampled under full sun and high humidity and from pressure probe measurements of the stomatal aperture versus guard cell turgor relationship at maximum and zero epidermal turgor, it was concluded that maximum stomatal apertures (and maximum leaf diffusive conductance) could not be obtained in at least one of the species (the grass Triticum aestivum) without a substantial reduction in subsidiary cell osmotic (and hence turgor) pressure during stomatal opening to overcome the large mechanical advantage of subsidiary cells. A mechanism for this is proposed, with a corollary being greatly accelerated stomatal opening and closure. Gas-exchange measurements on T. aestivum revealed the capability of very rapid stomatal movements, which may be explained by the unique morphology and mechanics of its dumb-bell-shaped stomata coupled with “see-sawing” of osmotic and turgor pressure between guard and subsidiary cells during stomatal opening or closure. Such properties might underlie the success of grasses.},

Mosses and hornworts are the earliest among extant land plants to have stomata, but unlike those in all other plants, bryophyte stomata are located exclusively on the sporangium of the sporophyte. Liverworts are the only group of plants that are entirely devoid of stomata. Stomata on leaves and stems of tracheophytes are involved in gas exchange and water transport. The function of stomata in bryophytes is highly debated and differs from that in tracheophytes in that they have been implicated in drying and dehiscence of the sporangium. Over the past decade, anatomical, physiological, developmental, and molecular studies have provided new insights on the function of stomata in bryophytes. In this review, we synthesize the contributions of these studies and provide new data on bryophyte stomata. We evaluate the potential role of stomata in moss and hornwort life histories and we identify areas that will provide valuable data in ascertaining the evolutionary history and function of stomata across land plants.},

CO2 assimilation rate and stomatal conductance of over-expressers and the sdd1-1 mutant were unchanged compared with wild types when measured under the light conditions the plants were exposed to during growth. Lower stomatal density was compensated for by increased stomatal aperture and conversely, increased stomatal density was compensated for by reduced stomatal aperture. At high light intensities the assimilation rates and stomatal conductance of SDD1 over-expressers were reduced to 80\% of those in wild type plants. Areas beneath stomata and patches lacking stomata were analysed separately. In areas without stomata, maximum fluorescence yield (Fv / Fm) and quantum yield of photosystem II (Φ PSII) were significantly lower than in areas beneath stomata. In areas beneath stomata, Fv / Fm and Φ PSII were identical to levels measured in wild type leaves. At high light intensities over-expressers showed decreased photochemical quenching (qP) compared with wild types. However, the decrease of qP was significantly stronger in areas without stomata than in mesophyll areas beneath stomata. At high CO2 partial pressures and high light intensities CO2 assimilation rates of SDD1 over-expressers did not reach wild type levels. These results indicate that photosynthesis in SDD1 over-expressers was reduced because of limiting CO2 in areas furthest from stomata at high light.},

            Stomata regulate the supply of CO2 for photosynthesis and the rate of water loss out of the leaf. The presence of stomata on both leaf surfaces, termed amphistomy, increases photosynthetic rate, is common in plants from high light habitats, and rare otherwise. In this study I use optimality models based on leaf energy budget and photosynthetic models to ask why amphistomy is common in high light habitats. I developed an R package leafoptimizer to solve for stomatal traits that optimally balance carbon gain with water loss in a given environment. The model predicts that amphistomy is common in high light because its marginal effect on carbon gain is greater than in the shade, but only if the costs of amphistomy are also lower under high light than in the shade. More generally, covariation between costs and benefits may explain why stomatal and other traits form discrete phenotypic clusters.},

	abstract = {"Stomatal clustering," an abnormal stomatal patterning that is formed by two or more stomata in the leaf epidermis, has been reported in more than 60 species of terrestrial plants. According to the characters and distributional pattern, two different types of stomatal clusters were identified, However, calculation of R-values in 16 different plant species showed that the classical method in spatial ecology study could not distinguish between these two types of clusters. Therefore, to classify them, the term "contiguous cluster" and "non-contiguous cluster" were introduced. Their formation and ecological significance were also discussed. In order to study whether stomatal clustering occurs in response to the environment, Vicia faba L. were cultivated under different water/salinity levels. Epidermis bioassay was conducted 2 weeks after the treatment. The results showed that drought and salt stresses significantly increased the stomatal density and stomatal index. More importantly, the occurrences of contiguous stomatal clustering also raised along the drought/salt gradients. The result suggests that the stomatal clustering is correlated with environmental signals. It could serve as a new marker for environmental adaptation in terrestrial plants.},

	abstract = {CO2 faces a series of resistances while diffusing between the substomatal cavities and the sites of carboxylation within chloroplasts. The absence of techniques to measure the resistance of individual steps makes it difﬁcult to deﬁne their relative importance. Resistance to diffusion through intercellular airspace differs between leaves, but is usually of minor importance. Leaves with high photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf area reduce mesophyll resistance by increasing the surface area of chloroplasts exposed to intercellular airspace per unit leaf area, Sc. Cell walls impose a signiﬁcant resistance. Assuming an effective porosity of the cell wall of 0.1 or 0.05, then cell walls could account for 25\% or 50\% of the total mesophyll resistance, respectively. Since the fraction of apoplastic water that is unbound and available for unhindered CO2 diffusion is unknown, it is possible that the effective porosity is {\textless}0.05. Effective porosity could also vary in response to changes in pH or cation concentration. Consequently, cell walls could account for {\textgreater}50\% of the total resistance and a variable proportion. Most of the remaining resistance is imposed by one or more of the three membranes as mesophyll resistance can be altered by varying the expression of cooporins. The CO2 permeability of vesicles prepared from chloroplast envelopes has been reduced by RNA interference (RNAi) expression of NtAQP1, but not those prepared from the plasma membrane. Carbonic anhydrase activity also inﬂuences mesophyll resistance. Mesophyll resistance is relatively insensitive to the manipulation of any step in the pathway because it represents only part of the total and may also be countered by pleiotropic compensatory changes. The parameters in greatest need of additional measurements are Sc, mesophyll cell wall thickness, and the permeabilities of the plasma membrane and chloroplast envelope.},
